===========

Implementation of a sliding menu in android following the tutorial over at [Android Hive](http://www.androidhive.info/2013/11/android-sliding-menu-using-navigation-drawer/).

Things that might prove useful later on.

1. IDE used was [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)
2. [GenyMotion emulator](http://www.genymotion.com/) (Personal use license). I would definitely recommend you use this. Setup information can be found [here](https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/launchpad/download/). You need to register an account to access it.
3. Build settings can be found at app/build.gradle
